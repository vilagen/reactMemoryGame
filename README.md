# reactMemoryGame
A Memory Game using React. The goal of this Brooklyn Nine-Nine game is to only click on each character once until you click on all 12 
different characters. If you click on all 12 unique characters you will win. If you click on the same person twice, you will lose, and the 
number of your matches go back down to zero. With the power of react though, every time a character is clicked on, their images will 
shuffle around, so you truly have to remember which of the 12 characters you already clicked on.

If you wish to cheat, or at least test to make sure that the winning conditions do work, you can console log the page to see what 
characters you have already selected. (They are going into an array). Of course, the goal of the game is to try to remember the selections 
you already choose.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project was to get an understanding of how React works with a website. This is meant to be something a little more 
simple that doesn't have links to other pages. But with react, it shows how it can not only make a page completely dynamic, but also how 
elements can be moved around and used again in different ways. 

## Future Implements:
A future implement would be to learn how to make pages load faster that use react. When launching it for the first time, it can take up to 
30 seconds.

If more time allows, another goal would be to try to put different levels of difficulty in place. That if a user choose a difficulty, they 
would have more or less characters to choose from.
